<section><h2>2.39:1 Aka Theater Format Have Bars On Tv Coz Most Tvs Are 16:9 But The Image Resolution Is Full Hd Or 4K Or Whatever Anyway.</h2><br/><p>So, if a standard definition video plays on a 16:9 display, black bars emerge on either side of a video to fill the resulting empty space: The reason that you see black bars on some movie content is that many films use wider aspect ratios than 16x9. I&#039;ve just never heard of it actually working til now.</p><h2>Yes I Know Its Because The Aspect Ratio Is Different, The Question Is Why Not Record A Show Bound For Netflix In The Aspect Ratio That Almost Every Tv Is?</h2><br/><p>I have had this problem since a two to three months now.

It&#039;s built into your hdmi cable, your monitor, and windows os. Whether you prefer having black bars, a distorted ratio or cropped sides is a very personnal preference, and netflix should at least give you the option.</p><h2>Pretty Much Everything Has It.</h2><br/><p>It is really annoying looking for good shows, but since the majority of the shows on netflix are basically garbage, on every single show i have to google it just to see if it is good. The black bars are not caused by resolution lol its the image format (image ratio) of the movie/series and its a production choice. Someday i’ll have to find out about this stuff.</p></section><section><aside><img alt="Top London &amp; UK &amp; Ireland &amp; Scotland" rel="nofollow" title="Top London &amp; UK &amp; Ireland &amp; Scotland" src="https://i2.wp.com/londonweed.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/walesweed-1200x675.jpg" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><small><i>Images: google.com</i></small><br/><p><a href="#" target="_blank"><i>Top London &amp; UK &amp; Ireland &amp; Scotland</i></a>, Changing the aspect ratio will squeeze, stretch or squash the image, so it’s not a feature that is allowed.
