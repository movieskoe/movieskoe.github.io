<section><h2>Eddie Quickly Reminds The Reader That Anne Isn&#039;t Alive, And They Never Had Kids Together.</h2><br/><p>In comics, the venom symbiote used to need a chemical in the brain called phenelytilamine, a chemical found in the human brain, the symbiote even tried to make eddie a cannibal, but eddie found a solution, chocolates: Yes, venom &amp; eddie had a symbiote baby together There&#039;s reason to believe sleeper will return later to change the face of the marvel universe, but for now, let&#039;s start where plenty of venom fans will be thrown completely off:</p><h2>(Fanart, Obviously) The Offsprings Of The Symbiote.</h2><br/><p>Scream, riot, agony, lasher, and phage(left to right): Venom has had seven kids like this in the comics, including carnage. Cletus consumes eddie and venomâs combined blood, in turn, birthing carnage.</p><h2>Heâs Kind Of A Loser On His Planet Too, And Heâs A Bit Smitten With The Idea Of Teaming Up With Eddie To Make Something Better Out Of Both.</h2><br/><p>When cletus turns violent, venomâs overprotective nature causes an altercation during which cletus bites them. He was a reporter who had success, that then turned into failure, and bonded with a symbiote named klyntar. Heâs only had two of them while bonded to eddie, but like i said before, eddie does not get pregnant.</p><h2>The Child Of Venom &amp; Eddie Brock Is Finally Born.</h2><br/><p>Those are the sons of venom. He woke up screaming, then vomited, much like an expectant parent would, hinting at what&#039;s to come. Plus they literally have a child together.</p><h2>In All Honesty, Venom Was Determined To Fulfil His Promise To His Host, But He May Have Exaggerated How Easy And Willing He Was To Go Along With It.</h2><br/><p>Symbiotes asexually reproduce with no need for pregnancy. According to eddie, when venom is living in his body, he has to follow his rules. Eddie brock&#039;s mother died in childbirth when he was born, leading to him developing an antagonistic relationship with his father.</p></section><section><aside><img alt="carnagesymbiote on Tumblr" rel="nofollow" title="carnagesymbiote on Tumblr" src="https://i2.wp.com/64.media.tumblr.com/4e1c6e9f10bc35a91c683674db720106/tumblr_pcm60r337I1rawb5do2_640.jpg" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><small><i>Images: google.com</i></small><br/><p><a href="#" target="_blank"><i>carnagesymbiote on Tumblr</i></a>, He is usually displayed as a hero in the movie.
