Several of these other heroes carnage has defeated.</p><h2>Carnage, Then, Is More Powerful, Violent, And Thus Deadly Than Venom, And Became His Archenemy In The Comics.</h2><br/><p>It often takes more than one hero to stop him and it took an entire legion in absolute carnage. Now that you mentioned the tentacles i realized venom doesn’t make them. Because kasady is a deranged serial killer, they share a sadistic personality and their bond is stronger than that between venom and eddie, and carnage increases kasady’s violent tendencies.</p><h2>That Way If Eddie Gets Hurt Or Something Venom Can Essentially Heal Eddie&#039;s Injures Faster.</h2><br/><p>When carnage was born sure he was stronger than venom but over the years venoms gotten stronger In the comics, eddie was in a prison cell with cletus when venom&#039;s spawn accessed kasady through a cut in his hand.
