We don’t know if the film will feature all five symbiotes from the comics. The venom franchise is arguably one of the more divisive in the superhero movie genre.</p><h2>In The Comics There Isn’t Inherent Meaning To Colors, Since Symbiotes Can Camouflage And Be Whatever Color They Want.</h2><br/><p>In much the same way the venom symbiote and its host, eddie brock, initially spawned carnage (and the other symbiote characters who inspired the life foundation symbiotes in 2019’s venom. For the film we don’t know yet, it might be that abnormally powerful symbiotes tend to be red. The symbiote doesn't need to mate either, as it can reproduce asexually.</p><h2>The Other Options Are Agony And Lasher, Who We Mentioned Before.</h2><br/><p>Riot is a lot like venom. He could just about hold his own against riot but was. Like venom, carnage has had multiple hosts over the years, but the most infamous remains the first, the serial killer, cletus kasady, whose personality perfectly matches that.</p><h2>The Talkative And Cantankerous Venom Was, Of Course, The Star Of The Show, With All His Hilarious Zingers And Insults As He Argued Endlessly With His Hapless Host And Other People Who.</h2><br/><p>It subsequently bonded with him, and ultimately became that film&#039;s version of venom (played by topher grace). He&#039;s large, powerful, and overall, just a gigantic brute. Between, venom is the 998th of it&#039;s lineage, carnage is the 999th, and toxin is the 1000th.</p><h2>Riot First Appeared In Venom:</h2><br/><p>The deleted symbiote scene that would have changed everything in venom.
