In general, dc&#039;s stories (at least as of late) tend to swing darker. Tons of women, people of color (look marvel more than two women in our films and they arent all white, what a concept) and various types of people not just in terms of race but nationality and personality.</p><h2>15 Ways Dc Tv Shows Are Better Than Marvel&#039;s.</h2><br/><p>In addition, marvel takes more risks, so they come out with highly unique movies such as guardians of the galaxy. While marvel may have the upperhand when it comes to cinematics, dc has it beat because of its characters and impact on the world. Is dc better than marvel?</p><h2>Dc Is Much More Than That.</h2><br/><p>Yes, dc comics has made wonder woman, aquaman, shazam, birds of prey, the dark knight trilogy. Unlike with dc, not a lot of marvel characters are seeing a return in the franchise&#039;s films or tv. Many dc characters are godlike in their abilities, as opposed to the more street level marvel u.</p><h2>Dc Also Has Marvel Beat When It Comes To Treating Female Characters Like.</h2><br/><p>While there are many differences between the characters, they are all united under the banner of superheroism. Marvel is all about fighting against villains and saving the world. I just really enjoy the stories, the fantastical and weird concepts that dc has.</p><h2>The Main Reason Why Dc Comics Outshine Marvel Comics Is Because The Characters In The Universe Are More Unique And More Empowering.</h2><br/><p>Dc is more diverse than marvel.

I'd actually argue that marvel is far more overpowered than dc due to marvel being more cosmic. Dc openly shows the struggles of superheroes.
