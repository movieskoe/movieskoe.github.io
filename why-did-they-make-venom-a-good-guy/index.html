<section><h2>Ultimately, Eddie Brock Developed An Individual Moral Code That, Albeit Imperfect, Leaned More On The Side Of Good Than Anything Else.</h2><br/><p>But the short version is that knull created the klyntar to be evil, then they decided they wanted to be good, but because they need to absorb hosts, if the symbiotes come in contact with an evil. It doesn&#039;t make much sense to have two. Venom had a bit of a weak storyline to it but it was good once they got into the meat and potatoes.</p><h2>The Symbiotes Have That Ability But Do Not Normally Consume The Life Force Of A Host.</h2><br/><p>Eddie brock and the venom symbiote often feed each other's worst tendencies. Inhabiting eddie brock allowed venom to survive on earth, while venom was able to heal eddie's injuries and give him superhuman strength and reflexes. This is why we have venom down as an antihero.</p><h2>Toxin Is Stronger Than Venom, And At Various Times Venom Has Hoped He Could Make The Symbiote Into A Relative Good Guy Like Him.</h2><br/><p>Hardy and venom&#039;s chemistry, for the most part, is enjoyable to watch, especially by the film&#039;s end. Sadly, in even this goal, the filmmakers fell short. Both in the symbiote suit as well as in his eddie brock human form.</p><h2>Although An Explanation Of Why It May Kill Spiderman And Not Other Hosts Could Be Because They Can&#039;t Bond To Him Like The Other Hosts, And The Venom Symbiote Chooses To Drain Spiderman Instead.</h2><br/><p>If eddie brock were to catch cletus kasady in human form, it wouldn’t be much of a fight as eddie brock is a physical beast in human form as well. Compared to how he speaks in comics, which kind of makes it more approachable and easier to turn the symbiote into something cute. Although their relationship began poorly, partly because eddie&#039;s life was in the midst of completely falling apart, they achieved true symbiosis by the movie&#039;s end.</p><h2>He Stopped Being A Villain, That Much Is Certain, But He Never Became A True Hero Either, Although He Got “Dangerously” Close To It.</h2><br/><p>Venom is a mish mosh of styles that starts out as a horror movie (the excellent ludwig göransson’s ominous, campy score is the first clue.) and then hardy starts rolling his eyes like a symbiotic mix of travis bickie and rupert pupkin, and a whole new movie emerges. So good, good, good, good job on both of them on that track. It was a bit contrived in order to get venom merged with eddie brock (tom hardy) but they did a good job making the audience forget how we&#039;d gotten to the action.</p></section><section><aside><img alt="5 Reasons Why Owning A is Just the Worst" rel="nofollow" title="5 Reasons Why Owning A is Just the Worst" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.luxury4play.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lamborghini-Huracan-RWD-Spyder-LAI-9-600x400.jpg" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><small><i>Images: bing.com</i></small><br/><p><a href="#" target="_blank"><i>5 Reasons Why Owning A is Just the Worst</i></a>, Secondly, over time, the symbiote subtly alters the host&#039;s behavior.
