The mad titan first used this power to travel back in time and kill the celestial order, alien beings who first discovered the heart of the universe. Thanos discovered this when he wiped out the heroes who were opposing him in marvel:</p><h2>The Level Determines The Final Score, Of.</h2><br/><p>Team darkseid (soulfire formula) vs team thanos (heart of the universe) lucifer morningstar vs team beyonder. Thus the ultimate form of thanos corresponds to the moment in which he possesses the heart of the universe.

Only those who can match the oaa is power can match thanos in power. Thanos (heart of the universe) in the comic thanos actually defeated akhenaten with the heart of the universe, even though akhenaten was infinitely powerful.</p><h2>But Take Notice Of One Thing Here.</h2><br/><p>No one is aware, save those whose awareness transcends mortal boundaries, that this event has even occurred. Therefore, the heart of the universe is even more powerful than the living tribunal.
